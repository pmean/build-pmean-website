      journal articles.

AB  - Retractions of scientific articles are becoming the most relevant institution for 
      making sense of scientific misconduct. An increasing number of retracted articles, 
      mainly attributed to misconduct, is currently providing a new empirical basis for 
      research about scientific misconduct. This article reviews the relevant research 
      literature from an interdisciplinary context. Furthermore, the results from these 
      studies are contextualized sociologically by asking how scientific misconduct is 
      made visible through retractions. This study treats retractions as an emerging 
      institution that renders scientific misconduct visible, thus, following up on the 
      sociology of deviance and its focus on visibility. The article shows that 
      retractions, by highlighting individual cases of misconduct and general policies for 
      preventing misconduct while obscuring the actors and processes through which 
      retractions are effected, produce highly fragmented patterns of visibility. These 
      patterns resemble the bifurcation in current justice systems.
